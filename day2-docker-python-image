Steps to Containerize Your App
Here is a step-by-step guide and example files:
#
  #come out of the spring hello directory 
  cd ..
  #lets create a new directort
  mkdir pyapp
  cd pyapp
  #inside the directory create a file app.py and copy paste from line 13 till 23 and save the file
1. Create a Flask Application
First, create a simple Flask application file (e.g., app.py). 

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, Docker!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
      
2. Create a Requirements File
Create a requirements.txt file in the same directory to list your Python dependencies. and put line 27
      
Flask
3. Create a Dockerfile 
Create a file named Dockerfile (no extension) in your project's root directory. This file contains instructions for Docker on how to build the image. 
dockerfile
      #inside the docker file add line 33 till line 54
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

# Run the application when the container starts
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
4. Build the Docker Image 
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory (where Dockerfile, app.py, and requirements.txt are located), and run the following command. The -t flag tags the image with a name (my-flask-app in this case), and the . at the end specifies the build context (current directory) [1, 2]. 
bash
docker build -t my-flask-app .
5. Run the Docker Container 
Once the image is built, run it as a container using the following command. The -p 5000:5000 flag maps port 5000 on your host machine to port 5000 in the container [1, 2]. 
bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask_container my-flask-app
6. Verify the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You should see the "Hello, Docker!" messag
